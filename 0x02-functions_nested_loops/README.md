## C - Functions, nested loops
The below is a list of C files containing programs which perform various operations.

- ***Description of programs:***

**0-putchar.c :** A Function that prints \_putchar, followed by a new line.

**1-alphabet.c :** A Function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**2-print_alphabet_x10.c :** A Function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

**3-islower.c :** A Function that checks for lowercase character.  
  - Prototype: int \_islower(int c);  
  - Returns 1 if c is lowercase  
  - Returns 0 otherwise  

**4-isalpha.c :** A Function that checks for alphabetic character.  
  - Prototype: int isalpha(int c);  
  - Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase  
  - Returns 0 otherwise  

**5-sign.c :** A Function that prints the sign of a number.  
  - Prototype: int print_sign(int n);  
  - Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero  
  - Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero  
  - Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero  

**6-abs.c :** A Function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

**7-print_last_digit.c :** A Function that prints the last digit of a number.  
  - Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);  
  - Returns the value of the last digit  

**8-24_hours.c :** A Function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.  
  - Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);  
  - You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)  

**9-times_table.c :** A Function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.  
  - Prototype: void times_table(void);  
  
**10-add.c :** A Function that adds two integers and returns the result.  
  - Prototype: int add(int, int);  

**11-print_to_98.c** : A Function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.  
  - Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);  
  - Numbers are separated by a comma, followed by a space  
  - Numbers are separated by a comma, followed by a space  
  - The first printed number is the number passed to the function  
  - The last printed number should be 98
