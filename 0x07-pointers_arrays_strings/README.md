### Even more pointers, arrays and strings

Below is a name list of C files containing fuctions that perform specific tasks.

**0-memset.c :** Contains a Function that fills memory with a constant byte.  
- The function \_memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b.  
- Returns a pointer to the memory area s.

**1-memcpy.c :** Contains a Function that copies memory area.  
- The \_memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest.   
- Returns a pointer to dest.    

**2-strchr.c :** Contains a Function that locates a character in a string.   
- Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found.

**3-strspn.c :** Contains a Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.    
- Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept.

**4-strpbrk.c :** Contains a Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.  
- The \_strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept.  
- Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found.                                      

**5-strstr.c :** Contains a Function that locates a substring.  
- The \_strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared.  
- Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.  

**7-print_chessboard.c :** Contanis a Function that prints the chessboard.

**8-print_diagsums.c :** Contanis a Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
