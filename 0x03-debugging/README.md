### C Program Debugging 

This project is about debugging the code in certain C files in order for them to run successfully.

**1.** The file **0-main.c** tests that the function **positive_or_negative()** in the file **main.h** gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

**2.** The part of the code in **1-main.c** that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop have been commented out.

**3.** The code in **2-largest_number.c** has been fixed so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

**4.** The program **3-print_remaining_days.c** converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.  The function **print_remaining_days()** has been fixed so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
